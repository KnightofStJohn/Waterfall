v0.5.0
------
- Rewrote effect application backend with a few enhancements
 - SUBTRACT, ADD modifier modes actually work properly now
 - Performance improvements overall
 - Even more major performance issues when effects are fully transparent
- Somewhat changed how atmospheric depth is calculated, result should be fairly in line with SmokeScreen/RealPlume implemenation for better compatibility

- Improved light color controllers
- Shaders
  - Updated Additive (Dynamic) shader with a few bug fixes for HDR
  - Updated Alpha (Directional) shader to work sgnificantly better in general
  - Addded Alpha (Dynamic) shader which is broadly the same as Addtive but alpha
  - Added some manual z-sorting handling to deal with alpha/additive transparency sorting issues
- Templates:
 - Major template update from Zorg with dozens of new templates and many fixes/improvements
 - New RS-25 plume by KnightOfStJohn
 - Updates and improvements to existing garbo Nertea templates
 
v0.4.1
------
- Changing TextureScale, TextureOffset and Vector3/4 material properties in the editor will now apply to multiple instances of a plume (e.g on multiple thrust transforms) immediately rather than requiring reload
- EffectRotationModifier now uses local Euler angles instead of local look rotation. 
- Added a Speed parameter to the perlin noise controller
- Exposed _Seed material parameter for noise in the UI
- Added ability to specify Randomize Noise Seed at effect creation, which causes _Seed to be randomized upon effect creation. Disabling this allows the effect _Seed to be modified in the material editor

v0.4.0
------
- Fixed shader time offset causing random scaling of shader speed values
- Reorganized the UI overall, with many improvements, some highlights
 - It is now possible to export a complete ModuleWaterfallFX
 - It is now possible to edit Effect names 
 - It is now possible to re-order Effect Modifiers
 - Added more detailed Controller UI
   - Only controllers present on the module are shown
   - Can add, edit and remove controllers
   - Controllers can be overridden individually
   - When not overridden, controllers will try to show the value of the controller
 - Many QOL improvements
- Added ability to specify noise type to Random controller: can use random (old one) or perlin (basic 1d perlin noise)
- Added new controllers
 - Mach: outputs current Mach number
 - Gimbal: outputs gimbal fraction, where 1/-1 is full extension, 0 is centered. Needs axis specified.
 - EngineEvent: event controller, fairly prototypical. Two events are currently available, ignition and flameout. 


v0.3.0
------
- Fixed some bugs with the RCS controller
- Updates to some templates
- Added waterfall-hydrolox-lower-3: Delta IV lower stage hydrolox engine

- Added new LightColorModifier, link a Material color to the color of a Light
- Improved spotlight and floodlight templates (cones and flares adjust to RGB colour of the light, flare effect is no longer removed outside of the atmosphere)

v0.2.8
------
- Added better HDR handling to shaders, should result in less TUFX breakage in HDR mode

v0.2.5
------

v0.2.4
------

- Fixed some log messages that didn't have a log level

v0.2.3
------
- Fixed DDS format of some flare textures

v0.2.2
